# Daimler Garay's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website!  
This project is **built entirely with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** using the [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) web framework.  
It serves as both a personal showcase and an ongoing learning process for modern Rust-based web development.

## Project Goals

- **Showcase myself** as a software developer, with info about my background, skills, and projects.
- **Learn and explore Rust** for full-stack development, with a focus on best practices and modern frontend patterns.
- **Experiment with Leptos**, a fast, full-featured Rust framework for building interactive web apps.
